### This project structure:
- four algorithms folder: DSSM, LightGCN, SASRec, and GRU4Rec.
- In the tool folder, code including related process, split rule, dataset, dataloader, evaluator and filter rule.
- In the code folder, code transforming modal information into an embedding 
- In the DataSet, store the dataset we use.
### for any  algorithms folder, include:
- baselilne algorithms.
- strength with modal information(title, cover, title+cover).
- a final version incorporating all the different types above (can be switched with a specific command and flag)
